"""
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. For example, the following binary tree is of height

:

Function Description

Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.

getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):

    root: a reference to the root of a binary tree.

Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer
, the number of nodes in the tree.
Next line contains space separated integer where

th integer denotes node[i].data.

Note: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.

Constraints


Output Format

Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

Sample Input

Sample Output

3

Explanation

The longest root-to-leaf path is shown below:

There are
nodes in this path that are connected by edges, meaning our binary tree's .
